# django-polls-tutorial

This is the solution code to the [Django official tutorial](https://github.com/Chive/django-poll-app).

I made it as a quick way to clone a working Django app.

The idea is to have a branch for each version of Django but I won't promise I'll actually do it ðŸ˜›

Working branches:

- [django-1.10](../../tree/django-1.10)
